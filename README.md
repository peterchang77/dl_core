# Configuration 

The code and tutorials in this repository work without any additional configuration if you load via links to Google Colob below. If you wish to replicate this environment on a local machine of Jupyter server, you will need to first install the `dl_utils` library. More information can be found here:

`https://github.com/peterchang77/dl_utils`

# Tutorials

Any `*.ipynb` tutorial can be run directly from GitHub in a Google Colab hosted Jupyter instance using the following URL pattern:
